            <p>One of the most captivating concepts prevalent in today's society is the field of computer science. This expansive and dynamic industry offers numerous pathways and avenues for exploration and comprehension.</p>
            <p>The primary catalyst behind my decision to pursue a career in this field is the desire to actively participate in transformative change. However, this is not just any ordinary change; it pertains to revolutionizing the world and shaping the future. This prospect not only ignites my curiosity but also propels me to generate innovative ideas and venture beyond conventional boundaries. Such profound transformations possess the potential to redefine our familiar reality and propel us towards a progressive future that is not only sustainable but also embraced by a vast majority of individuals. </p>

            <h2 id="previously">Interests</h2>
            <p>While the computer science industry presents numerous avenues, a select few have captured my attention, particularly from a product management perspective. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Botting/Reselling</strong> - The intersection of software and the reselling market intrigues me. I am fascinated by the opportunity to create a fluid and automated product that caters to everyone's reselling needs while ensuring inclusivity. </li>
                <li><strong>Video Games</strong> - Understanding the fundamental aspects of the video game industry is of great interest to me. Subgenres like augmented reality and spatial recognition not only captivate me but also hold the potential to shape the future of this vertical. Exploring these areas from a product management standpoint excites me. </li>
                <li><strong>Automobile/Cars</strong> - The concept of cars and the software driving them has always fascinated me. Self-driving cars not only represent the future but also offer the potential for safer transportation. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the software intricacies in this category will contribute to a flourishing future, especially from a product management perspective. </li>
                <li><strong>Climate Tech</strong> - This field stands out as one of the most captivating and significant areas within computer science. The progress required in this industry is immense. Time is a critical factor, as failure to take steps toward eco-sustainability could result in irreversible damage to our planet. Exploring and contributing to climate tech from a product management standpoint holds great importance to me. </li>
            </ul>
